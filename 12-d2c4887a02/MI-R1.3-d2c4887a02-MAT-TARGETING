    fairmi:rationale "Targeting: Another area of considerable research interest is the design of 'targeted' materials intended to demonstrate affinity for specific tissues or cells. One strategy to accomplish this is through conjugation of targeting ligands to the surface of a particle, the effectiveness of which is dependent on both the amount of ligand and the method of attachment. Other strategies for targeting rely on the physicochemical properties of the material. If a carrier is designed for targeting through the addition of a ligand, the amount of ligand bound to the carrier should be reported. This is especially topical given recent questions about whether nanomedicine has a \"delivery problem\", if targeting should be our target, and how the performance of targeted nanomaterials compares to clinically used targeted therapies. The functional optimization of targeting is complex and not well understood�??a recent analysis found that only 3.5% of proteins attached to a surface of a particle had appropriate orientation for receptor recognition, and increasing antibody concentration on a particle�??s surface can reduce targeting. This suggests that the poor results observed during 2005�??2015 in tumour targeting may be due to operational rather than fundamental issues. Encouragingly, recent reports have described methods for determining receptor-binding behaviour at the molecular level on nanoparticles. As these methods mature, more complete and biologically meaningful descriptions of nanomaterials (for example, in terms of number or density of biologically functional ligands available on particle surfaces) will become easier to achieve. However, these emerging technologies are still new and outside the capability of many research groups. Thus, at present when a carrier designed for targeting is reported, some (semi-)quantitative assessment that the system demonstrates affinity and specificity for its target should be included. As these molecular-level assays become widespread, we believe that they will (and should) become part of future reporting standards.";
