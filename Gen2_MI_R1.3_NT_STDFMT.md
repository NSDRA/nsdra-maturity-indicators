### Maturity Indicator Identifier: Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_STDFMT [https://w3id.org/fair/maturity_indicator/terms/Gen2/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_STDFMT ](https://w3id.org/fair/maturity_indicator/terms/Gen2/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_STDFMT) 

This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

The ID of this MI is composed by appending the acronym (NT) which stands for (Nano Toxicity) and the acronym (STDFMT) which stands for "Standardized Format" to indicate that this MI is related to the standardized format if adopted by a nano toxicity study data.

### Maturity Indicator Name:  The Standardized format adopted by a nano toxicity study

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
R1.3

### What is being measured?
If the conducted study's data adopts a standardized format.

### Why should we measure it?
Adopting a standardized format when logging data reflects a higher level of quality and harmonies the logging of experimentally-produced data in the field of nano- environmental, health and safety. Using such formats empowers the ability of sharing and linking the data which brings benefits for both data managements and NanoQSAR and predictive toxicology models development.



### What must be provided for the measurement?
The Metadata: 

| Field Name          | Alternative terms                                            |                 Possible values                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------: |
| Standardized Format | StandardizedFormat, <br />standardized_format, <br />standardized-format | IOM–Nano–EHS,<br /> GRACIOUS, <br />ISA-TAB-Nano |



### How is the measurement executed?

The standardized format if adopted should be provided in a machine-readable format (e.g JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
One of the three accepted standards should be provided as a value for the standardized format metadata field :

- IOM–Nano–EHS [https://search-dev.data.enanomapper.net/help/#templatestyles](https://search-dev.data.enanomapper.net/help/#templatestyles) 
- GRACIOUS [https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC117733](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC117733) 
- ISA-TAB-Nano [https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC103178](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC103178)



### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
For nano toxicity related datasets. 

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
