# NanoMaturityIndicators
FAIR maturity indicators for nano-related datasets/databases/models

This repository aims at providing maturity indicators (MI) to assess the FAIRness of datasets/models/experiments related to the NanoToxicology domain for risk assessment applications.

The Maturity indicators follow the template provided by the "FAIR Maturity Testing and Evaluation" initiative by Mark Wilkinson [https://github.com/FAIRMetrics](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics). 

The template used is available in this repository folder: [https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/MaturityIndicators](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/MaturityIndicators)

Currently, ten maturity indicators are proposed under principle R1.3 to make sure the assessed study is qualified to be used in nanoQSAR applications.

Further maturity indicators will be added.
