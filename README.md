# NanoMaturityIndicators
FAIR maturity indicators for nano-related datasets/databases/models

This repository aims at providing maturity indicators (MI) to assess the FAIRness of datasets/models/experiments related to the NanoToxicology domain for risk assessment applications.

The Maturity indicators follow the template provided by the "FAIR Maturity Testing and Evaluation" initiative by Mark Wilkinson [https://github.com/FAIRMetrics](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics). 

The template used is available in this repository folder: [https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/MaturityIndicators](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/MaturityIndicators)

Currently, ten maturity indicators are proposed under principle R1.3 to make sure the assessed study is qualified to be used in nanoQSAR applications.

1. Physicochemical properties that should be characterized in a nano toxicity study (for nanoQSAR applications) [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_PCHEM.md)

2. The Minimum reporting standard (MIRIBEL) adopted by a nano toxicity study  [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_MIRIBEL.md)

3. The Standardized format adopted by a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_STDFMT.md) 

4. Measurements units are reported a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_UNIT.md)

   

   **The next six indicators relate to 3 aspects (Material characterization, Biological characterization, Experimental details), 2 indicators for each aspect:**

   

5. The nanomaterials coating details provided by a nano toxicity study  [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_MT_COATING.md)

6. The characterizations performed in a fluid mimicking biological conditions in a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_MT_BIOC.md)

7. The cell line details are reported by a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_BIO_CELLLINE.md)

8. The passage number is reported by a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_BIO_PASSAGE.md) 

9. The dose (experimental detail) is reported by a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_EXP_DOSE.md)

10. The cell culture details reported by a nano toxicity study [link](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/NanoMaturityIndicators/blob/main/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_EXP_CELLCULTURE.md)



More maturity indicators will be added.
