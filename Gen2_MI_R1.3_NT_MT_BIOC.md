### Maturity Indicator Identifier: Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_MT_BIOC [https://w3id.org/fair/maturity_indicator/terms/Gen2/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_MT_BIOC](https://w3id.org/fair/maturity_indicator/terms/Gen2/Gen2_MI_R1.3_NT_MT_BIOC)

This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

The ID of this MI is composed by appending the acronym (NT) which stands for (Nano Toxicity) and the suffix (MT_BIOC) which denotes the conditions for the characterization of the nanomaterial to indicate that this MI is to check if the study provides information about the biological conditions for the characterization. 

### Maturity Indicator Name:  The characterizations performed in a fluid mimicking biological conditions in a nano toxicity study

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
R1.3

### What is being measured?
Whether the characterizations performed in a fluid mimicking biological conditions.

### Why should we measure it?
The properties of the fluid has a considerable effect on the characterizations  of a nanomaterial. Therefore, if the characterizations is performed in a fluid mimicking biological conditions or not should be provided when using the characteristics as features for nanoQSAR and predictive toxicology model development.



### What must be provided for the measurement?
The Metadata: 

| Field name                                | Possible values |
| ----------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| characterization in biological conditions |   Yes/No, 0/1   |



### How is the measurement executed?

Whether the characterizations is performed in a fluid mimicking biological conditions should be provided in a machine-readable format (e.g JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
The value "Yes/No" OR "0/1" should be there for the metadata field's key "characterization in biological conditions".

### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
For nano toxicity related datasets. 

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
